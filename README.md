Simple bootstrap my ass. This one is really complicated x_x. That's what happens when
you're dealing with ultra-modular and tip of the edge technology. Things change,
sometimes rapidly. So this bootstrap might already be outdated when I created it,
but ehh it's fine. Only thing you really need is to have one sturdy project scaffold
that can withstand the tides of major updates and the pains of testing. So I try
to keep this one at minimal complexity but yeah, this react stuff is a lot more
complicated than Angular 1.0. GLHF.

Don't mind about the error in console about react-router. Supposedly it will be fixed
in the next-next major release 4.0 of react-router. :DD And fixing it now would really
make me flip my burgers hard so I won't do it.
